i have regrettably not kept up with all of the information that has been added to the hp world since the books were finished  in the next few years i would love to reread the whole series  but it would be really fun to have all of the new information interjected throughout with asides  footnotes  etc  thoughts ,45xsew,harrypotter,entertainment,1455559806,colinstalter,35,0,9011,23328,0
yes  i saw a new version of the annotated alice in wonderland the other day  and it s amazing  it s like a huge illustrated version  similar in sizeshape to the illustrated harry potter and the sorcerer s stone   but the actual story is written on like 13 of each page  with extra information and paragraphs and illustrations in the empty parts designwise  it s beautiful  and it s such a cool way to read the book  but it would have to be very wellthought out as far as what information is revealed when  ,d014oda,harrypotter,entertainment,1455573013,whitbeyondmeasure,2,0,44,2320,1
