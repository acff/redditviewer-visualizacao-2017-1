' they win by inculcating a mindset where people refuse to simply consider the possibility ( no way ! that 's crazy ! ) . so my suggestion to you is to try to jettison that mindset about everything. be willing to consider anything no matter how nuts it sounds , because who knows ? but at the same time , you need to be very skeptical and careful about accepting claims . as others have said , these waters are full of disinfo agents. they work by telling you partial truths. you want to believe them , and you do because you agree with what they say , but then they misdirect you in the end. another thing they like to do is get us fighting amongst each other about 'the truth. ' the 911 truth movement is a great example. so many people arguing over their version of exactly how it was done and exactly who was involved. they want to keep us distracted with in-fighting and spending days and weeks and months trying to figure out 'the truth. ' but be never will. and that 's ok because at some point it does n't really matter. we can see the outlines well enough. the question is what can we then do with that knowledge ? i 'm not sure . another word of advice is to be skeptical of anyone trying to make you afraid or hateful of other social groups on the basis of nationality , race , religion , political party , etc. the powers that be do n't care about that stuff. in fact they deliberately create those divisions and sow dissent. the wealthy bankers and their henchmen in politics and the military and esp. the intelligence community -- they 're the bad guys. everyone else is just being duped and manipulated by them .

"thank you for posting this . in 2001 , i had voted for republican candidates for 25 years in two deep south states ( tennessee and alabama ) . i spent the first 15 years of my career with the department of the army. i was totally unquestioning of my government , particularly the us military. i knew what to think and what to believe . the thing that convinced me something was wrong with the official investigation of the 9/11 wtc tower attacks was when my own federal senator , republican senator richard shelby , who was chairman of the senate select committee on intelligence when the investigating commission report was completed , and who saw the complete unexpurgated version of that report , told the nation publicly that the 28 pages that were concealed from the public were not related to national security , and the american people had every right to view them. he was subsequently accused of , and investigated for , divulging classified secrets in a fox news broadcast that was never aired ; in other words , they accused him of treason. fox news claimed that they halted the broadcast before any damage was done , but the accusation was out there . richard shelby backed off on the 9/11 commission report , and he was moved from intelligence to the senate banking committee , where he could do no more harm . shelby was put on notice : "" shut up willingly , or we _will_ shut you up. "" shelby went about as far as any congressman could in 2004 to put the truth before the public. i commend him for that . richard shelby was replaced as the chairman of the senate intelligence committee by us senator and former governor of florida , bob graham. graham had the guts to continue fighting both the bush and obama administrations to declassify those 28 pages of a 9/11 intelligence report that it is believed detail the efforts of members of the saudi arabian royal family to aid the 9/11 terrorists ( most of whom were themselves saudi ) when they were training in florida. ( 15 of the 19 hijackers carried saudi arabian passports ) . that saudi family , which was living in sarasota , left the us just before the attacks occurred. were they tipped off that they should leave ? if so , by whom ? the 9/11 intelligence report contains no smoking gun , but where it came even marginally close to the truth ; the source of that truth was immediately and conclusively shut down . we do n't know even the smallest percentage of the truth about what happened on 9/11/2001 , and we _never_ will , but i 'm damned glad there are a few people left who are willing to defend our right to know . do i believe that the wtc attacks were inside jobs ? not really. it 's certainly possible , but not really . do i believe that there is a whole lot more to the story of what happened that day , and we have been deliberately kept from knowing the truth ; and fed a bunch of lies ? absolutely , without question , i do believe that .",d01rhql,conspiracy,news,1455618871,CAulds,3,0,581,5231,0

"thank you for posting this . in 2001 , i had voted for republican candidates for 25 years in two deep south states ( tennessee and alabama ) . i spent the first 15 years of my career with the department of the army. i was totally unquestioning of my government , particularly the us military. i knew what to think and what to believe . the thing that convinced me something was wrong with the official investigation of the 9/11 wtc tower attacks was when my own federal senator , republican senator richard shelby , who was chairman of the senate select committee on intelligence when the investigating commission report was completed , and who saw the complete unexpurgated version of that report , told the nation publicly that the 28 pages that were concealed from the public were not related to national security , and the american people had every right to view them. he was subsequently accused of , and investigated for , divulging classified secrets in a fox news broadcast that was never aired ; in other words , they accused him of treason. fox news claimed that they halted the broadcast before any damage was done , but the accusation was out there . richard shelby backed off on the 9/11 commission report , and he was moved from intelligence to the senate banking committee , where he could do no more harm . shelby was put on notice : "" shut up willingly , or we _will_ shut you up. "" shelby went about as far as any congressman could in 2004 to put the truth before the public. i commend him for that . richard shelby was replaced as the chairman of the senate intelligence committee by us senator and former governor of florida , bob graham. graham had the guts to continue fighting both the bush and obama administrations to declassify those 28 pages of a 9/11 intelligence report that it is believed detail the efforts of members of the saudi arabian royal family to aid the 9/11 terrorists ( most of whom were themselves saudi ) when they were training in florida. ( 15 of the 19 hijackers carried saudi arabian passports ) . that saudi family , which was living in sarasota , left the us just before the attacks occurred. were they tipped off that they should leave ? if so , by whom ? the 9/11 intelligence report contains no smoking gun , but where it came even marginally close to the truth ; the source of that truth was immediately and conclusively shut down . we do n't know even the smallest percentage of the truth about what happened on 9/11/2001 , and we _never_ will , but i 'm damned glad there are a few people left who are willing to defend our right to know . do i believe that the wtc attacks were inside jobs ? not really. it 's certainly possible , but not really . do i believe that there is a whole lot more to the story of what happened that day , and we have been deliberately kept from knowing the truth ; and fed a bunch of lies ? absolutely , without question , i do believe that .",d01rhql,conspiracy,news,1455618871,CAulds,3,0,581,5231,0

"as much as one would hope attacking trumps conservative bona fides would be effective , i think the rules are different this year . i am no trump supporter , and if he is the nominee , well i probably will pull the plug for him over a clinton or a sanders. it is right back into the "" who is worse "" decision we have had the last several election cycles . i think this election is different. this president has so thoroughly screwed up on the basics that the voter is keenly aware that you can not take those basics for granted. his stimulus spending and the economy was an utter disaster , and we could have probably emerged from this recession sooner had we not gone down that path. his attempt to nationalize the health care industry has been utter failure , generating 30hr work weeks. his wide open border immigration policy has glutted the market with unskilled labor that drains the safety net and our public school system , and depresses wages for citizens who traditionally worked them. his foreign policy apology tour , russian reset , picking the muslim brotherhood in egypt , drawing red lines then doing nothing , blaming terrorist action on a youtube video rather than the secretary 's optics policies....all of this is screw up on all the basics . so when trump goes out there and thumps his chest on immigration , or he talks about building up the military , or running the economy like a business , and not once apologizing for the nation he loves , people see he has the basics right. over and over he hammers on these basics. all his focus is on that , and people understand it . so when a paul or a cruz gets up there and makes a nuanced consitutional point , they do n't really get it , and they come back to trump , and how he is going to be the payback for what this president screwed up . when a bush or a rubio or a kasich gives their usual wormy response about pathways to citizenship , the public most clearly knows that not a single one of them has the basics right. they go back to trump who is there hammering home deportations and walls . so by pushing depth and breadth of issues and ignoring the basics , this field facing trump really do not get the mood of this public. obama has so royally screwed up , that we can no longer count on basics. these other candidates could stand to learn from trump and drive home the basics more. they could stand to learn from reagan who was a master at educating the public on the basics of free market v. socialism . until it is clear any candidate has the basics seared into their brains and knows what their marching orders are from their boss , the american people , trump will still draw off votes with the basics , and the public will ignore depth and breadth issues. take that wind out of his sails and a harder look at depth and breadth is in order .",d029ugy,conservative,news,1455652717,Lepew1,1,0,4763,10169,0

"&gt ; the chief and real purpose of the republican party is eminently conservative. it proposes nothing save and except to restore this government to its original tone in regard to this element of slavery , and there to maintain it , looking for no further change in reference to it than that which the original framers of the government themselves expected and looked forward to . -abraham lincoln millenials support gun rights as much as older americans , are less supportive of abortion than gen x , and are the least likely generation to call themselves environmentists . in recent history , the death penalty became legal , the gender equal rights amendment was stopped , and the mental healthcare system was dismantled. all to broad public support . to be frank , this article is a good illustration of what annoys me about the left. they have an irritating tendency to rewrite our history in the public mind until it is nothing but a string of victories. the nordic countries are pointed to as examples of the success of extensive welfare programs - yet the extreme homogeneity of their populations ( a classical conservative value ) is inexplicably ignored as irrelevant. the fact that the conservative fear of communist infiltration during the cold war was , post war , revealed to be totally justified is swept under the rug. that thry had a habit of supporting utter monsters just so long as they leaned left , even in the face of proof of their evils , is said to never have happened. of course the conservatives have their own evils too , which is why i try to be more centrist. but even centralism is not without its own flaws . there is blood on all our hands , and victory is never assured. to tell one 's self otherwise is to invite disaster . links : http : //housedivided.dickinson.edu/sites/lincoln/speech-at-columbus-september-16-1859/ http : //www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2014/03/10/287314912/4-reasons-the-pew-millennials-report-should-worry-democrats-too https : //en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/venona_project http : //www.economist.com/news/special-report/21570836-immigration-and-growing-inequality-are-making-nordics-less-homogeneous-ins-and https : //www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/05/01/everything-you-need-to-know-about-executions-in-the-united-states/ https : //en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/equal_rights_amendment https : //en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/cambodian_genocide_denial",d00infa,truereddit,news,1455531219,CuriousBlueAbra,7,0,0,0,

"this quote from the article rang true with me : &gt ; something even greater is at risk. the europe that rose from the cataclysm of world war ii understood itself not simply as a collection of peoples , white and christian , but as a community of shared values. the refugee crisis has forced europeans to choose between the moral universalism they profess and the ancient identities they have inherited. eastern europe has already reasserted its status as a white , christian homeland — just as many people in the middle east have reclaimed the sectarian identities they had seemed prepared to discard . &gt ; now the europe where the enlightenment was born may well be making the same choice. the muslim influx threatens europe ’ s liberal , secular consensus ; but rejecting the refugees also shakes one of the great pillars of that consensus. europe may fail on both counts , driving the refugees from its doorstep while succumbing to right-wing nationalism. americans have no reason to be complacent. it is all too possible that we will do the exact same thing . it 's extremely depressing that race and religion are still the sectarian lines we draw in our modern and globalized world .",czwlk8l,truereddit,news,1455230810,dwaxe,17,0,159937,47167,0

"&gt ; the notion that we should believe the victims – no matter what – not only is unhelpful , but has been thoroughly discredited by a series of widely publicized cases.. . i think there are two problems with the "" always believe the victim "" rule. first , as she says , sometimes the victim is wrong ( or the cops got the wrong guy , as in making a murderer ) . but , more importantly , what we believe is simply not up to us. prove me wrong : look up at the sky , and believe that it 's green. telling someone what to believe is like telling your kid to like broccoli. the best you can do is to observe reality ; belief forms on its own . what 's missing from this discussion is the idea of statistical confidence levels. [ blackstone 's rule ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blackstone's_formulation ) implies that we should be at least 91 % confident of guilt in order to imprison somebody. if i 'm only 60 % confident in ghomeshi 's guilt , that 's enough to keep me away from him , but not enough to put him in prison. if i knew one of his accusers and she came to me for support , even a 10 % chance that she 's telling the truth would be enough for me to offer support . so , instead of "" always believe the victim "" we should say something like : offer support to the accuser if there 's even a slim chance that ( s ) he 's telling the truth , but do n't attack the accused. learn about the frighteningly high rates of sexual violence in society , particularly from acquaintances and accompanied by alcohol consumption. learn about the specifics of the case in question before passing judgment. you ca n't make yourself believe the accuser , but you can learn the facts that lead other people to believe accusers in general .",czzlcvi,truereddit,news,1455463377,nopus_dei,14,0,55,1468,0

"when i walked into one of my favorite gun stores recently , i saw a plethora of new guns in the store. then out of the corner of my eye i noticed this gun sitting on a shelf off to the side. i ca n't say i have ever seen a roth-steyr m1907 or even any roth-steyr pistol before apart from a [ forgotten weapons video ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v = bautympsh9m ) on it. so when i went home and did some research , i had to have it. besides the fact that these guns are rare , this one in particular has a few interesting extras with it , which i will get to in a little bit . so lets start with the pistol ; i have a general idea of how it all works , but i have no god damn idea how they came up with the design. [ look at this picture ] ( http : //www.hungariae.com/manual/rothsteyassy.jpg ) . * look at it. * do you see all that extremely complex machining and how it all fits together ? it 's a nightmare. so i will hold off on taking it apart until i can practice putting a few watches back together as a warmup. however what i can see from examing the pistol are a few things. for one , it 's serial number and acceptance marks put 's its manufacture date at 1910 , with it being manufactured at * ö sterreichische waffenfabriks-gesellschaft steyr * ( austrian armament makers steyr company ) while others were manufactured at * fegyver- é s g é pgy á r budapest * ( arms and machine factory budapest. ) these i thought were particularly interesting places of manufacture , because this pistol was made * when austria-hungary was still a thing. * later on though , after the great war , these pistols were again re issued for various countries in the second world war , with hungary , austria , czechoslovakia and poland all receiving previously issued m1907 's. interestingly enough , the italians also fielded these in limited numbers during the second world war as well. as part of reparations from the great war , italy was given many of these pistols from austria-hungary. this pistol was reissued in 1934 to the austrian army because of the * hv 34 * ( heeresverwaltung 34 or army administration ) markings on the grip of the gun . next we see the holster , and as bulky as it looks it 's actually kind of cool. supposedly these can hold 6 loaded stripper clips , each clip holding 10 rounds of 8x19mm roth steyr m1907 ammunition. these holsters and pistols were issued to the austrian cavalry as a service pistol as a pistol that would not rely on a hammer fired action that could potentially be fired by the jolting of a horse. it fits nicely on a belt and feels solid , much like a p.08 holster but slightly longer . last we see the stripper clips , and these are no ordinary clips. since this gun contains an internal 10 round magazine , naturally stripper clips are useful in loading the gun effectively and these ones aid in loading the pistol with a thumb assist charger. however in this day and age , for some reason these clips are extremely rare and valueable. [ each clip is worth about $ 150 ] ( http : //www.gunauction.com/buy/8892837 ) and i was lucky enough to buy a gun with four of them . i have yet to shoot this gun , but i am pleasantly surprised to find fiocci still makes this ammo for the mildly painful price of $ .70 a round , so maybe i 'll order a couple boxes before the five other people in the country who shoot these guns buy them .",d01iqv4,guns,lifestyle,1455595149,turn_down_for_hwhut,17,0,4360,3626,0

"i was tired of each day being a flurry of todo 's bouncing around in my head. i was also mortified at the days when i stumbled across large pockets of free time , and dicked around on the internet instead of using that precious time constructively . enter the scheduling system. i 've been using this method for the last few months , and it has rocked my world. i 'm getting more stuff done , and more importantly , planning for free time and using it constructively. the best part is that it 's very simple . * * if you find stuff like this helpful , please consider signing up for my mailchimp list to be notified when new articles go up. i write about no-bs strategies to improve your daily hustle : http : //hackthegrind.net/subscribe/ * * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ # scheduling the day : a productivity method for entrepreneurs . until recently , i didn ’ t have a productivity system. i didn ’ t really need one - there was always work that needed doing , and i had various side projects to fill out the time. i was always pretty comfortable flowing from one task to another . but , letting my tasklist run the day had downsides. work expanded to fill the amount of time i had , meaning that i could increase my free time without increasing productivity. also , those side projects i pursued in my vanishing free time weren ’ t going anywhere . my tasklist dictated my time , but in a haphazard , thoughtless way. when i had something in front of me - especially with a deadline - i attacked it. but i lacked direction when there was no urgent problem to solve. i was great at bottoms-up execution , but not so great at top-down management . then i returned to consulting , and with it , multiple clients , complex projects and numerous deliverables , i also renewed my commitment to making serious progress on side projects. the “ flow ” wouldn ’ t do. i needed a system . # # tl ; dr : the scheduling system is basically a fusion of tasklist , project tracker and calendar into one entity. every night , i review outstanding tasks and ongoing projects , and i schedule them to available timeslots. completed tasks are checked off and disappear ; those that get missed are rescheduled at the next planning session. i try and fill in the entire day with appointments , even if they ’ re just “ go for a walk ” or “ travel to client. ” * * it works because scheduled things get done. * * the scheduling discipline has increased the number of tasks i complete each day and helped me make meaningful , sustained progress on larger projects. i ’ m much better at prioritizing , because the discipline brings my tasklist to bear against the reality of limited working hours . the scheduling discipline equips me with a plan for using my time well. it ’ s like eating healthy. if you “ try to eat healthier ” from whatever ’ s in front of you , you won ’ t do as well as someone who commits to a diet through grocery shopping and meal prep. one is aspiration , the other is a plan . the scheduling discipline works even when i don ’ t follow the actual schedule , which is nearly 100 % of the time. scheduling merely sets the goalpost. going off track doesn ’ t change the fact that i ’ ve prioritize what i need to do and committed to do it , which is the real struggle . here ’ s how i do it . # # tools : note - this is obviously for a mac setup. i ’ m sure you can find analogs for pc/android , i just don ’ t know what they are . * fantastical 2 , desktop and iphone apps. the os x calendar on steroids. has a lot of nice features , but the most critical is that it represents your reminders on a calendar . * iphone with siri and reminders. my system works only if it ’ s super-easy to enter new appointments and reminders . * icloud account ( for easy syncing between everything ) . # # the process 1. throughout the day , i save new tasks as reminders with a tentative timeframe attached. i usually dictate into my phone or type it into fantastical 2 ( “ remind me to call the dentist tomorrow morning ” ) . i always schedule tasks for a general time like “ tomorrow afternoon ” or “ friday morning ” . it gets moved to the right time in the nightly scheduling . 2. each night , i review and schedule tasks. this 10-15 minute ritual is the last thing i do in the work day. first , i pull up the calendar in fantastical , and drag all my unchecked reminders to open slots. simple stuff like phone calls and quick emails can all go into the same slot , to be handled in sequence , while a longer project will get its own slot . 3. in that same nightly review , i schedule the day ’ s activities. i use one primary account ( icloud calendar ) and put blocks down for projects , workouts , transit time , prep time for appointments , phone calls , meditation , meals and whatever else i want to accomplish . 4. during the day , i stick to the calendar when possible. i have it running constantly and try to address tasks and project work in the time its scheduled for . 5. but i don ’ t worry if the schedule gets blown up. sometimes i get taken off track by something important. other days , i ’ m not nearly as enthusiastic about the work i committed to , and i blow it off to get a massage or play insurgency. it ’ s like eating pizza after a hard training session ; discipline earns you guilt-free slacking. that night , i honestly account for what i did and didn ’ t do , and push things back accordingly . # # an example here ’ s a heavily simplified use case. a client has given me a project with two discrete items ; a task to check in with someone , and a hour of actual work to do . [ click here to see diagram ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/zbgntfp.png ) # # the benefits * * * doing all the planning in one session reduces mental strain. * * an unstructured task list makes your brain work every time you look at it. prioritizing tasks , estimating time/labor and thinking about when to do each item. batching the planning conserves mental calories for the actual work . better follow-through on tasks. scheduling things improves the chance they ’ ll get done , period - even if i don ’ t actually do them on the schedule. it seems nutty to schedule meditation , for instance , but i always seem to find time for it when i schedule it in . * * * free time is anticipated and used. * * i used to stumble over pockets of free time , and when i found them , i didn ’ t know what to do with myself. now , i fill wide-open spaces with productive uses of energy . * * * planning around my natural energy levels. * * i can block out time for big projects in the morning , schedule email replies after lunch , and generally anticipate what i ’ ll be best at . * * * better prepped and more polished. * * scheduling time to prep for meetings ensures that i walk into those meetings with the right documents , talking points and questions. even five minutes can mean the difference between a great meeting and a poor one . # # important caveats * * * this is not about being a robot. * * the schedule is a guide , not strict ; i prepare it as though i ’ ll stick to it , but i rarely stay 50 % on track. think of it this way : my natural productivity is about a c+. with this system , i plan for an a+ , and in executing wind up around a b/b+ . * * * this is not about “ manager ’ s schedule ” . * * my schedule includes huge blocks of time for writing sessions and other creative projects. the only parts of the day with micromanaged tasks are usually after lunch and the afternoon . * * * this is not about squeezing productivity from every second of the day. * * i actually relax more now , because my improved productivity opens up more time for long walks , cooking dinner and all the other things that make life fun. i generally schedule only between 8am and 4pm , and leave weekends completely clear . * * if you find stuff like this helpful , please consider signing up for my mailchimp list to be notified when new articles go up. i write about no-bs strategies to improve your daily hustle : http : //hackthegrind.net/subscribe/ * *",445jnp,lifehacks,lifestyle,1454597266,jpreeves,126,0,2367,6220,0

"my wife and i , when we got married , also did 3 weeks honeymoon in europe ( netherlands , france , germany , austria and italy ) . this was about 20 years ago. at the time , due to our age , under 26 , we were able to get "" student "" discounts on a lot of things ( most importantly rail ) . their rail system is awesome. the biggest mistake we made is that we traveled with too much luggage. i came a cross a young scottish chap , he was traveling all of europe for 2 months. here is a tip he gave me and i will give you. travel very light and take used clothes. he would wear the used clothes then toss them as they got dirty. then he would buy the touristy tshirts and such. when he got back home he had souvenirs and got ride of his old clothes. make sure you do bring one set of proper clothes. for example , i almost did n't get to go in st. peter 's bastilica at the vatican city because i had a tank top ( it was summer time ) . i ended up buying a tshirt and then able to enter. final tip , if you really want to fully enjoy europe and see it all. get the unlimited rail pass and visit a city for a day. then hop on and see another the following day. sleep for free on the train. if you need to sleep over there is now airbnb or worst case youth hostels. pack light snacks ( we would buy loaves of bread and cold cuts ) , carry little cash , etc. very important last note , europe is not like the us in that they have their way of doing things. for example , in italy and france they shut down from 12pm to 2pm for lunch. good luck trying to get anything done on a sunday ( again everything is closed ) . there is so much more. i will let others chime in. it really is another experience. enjoy .",czyzps0,frugal,lifestyle,1455408555,nuffstuff,5,0,954,776,0

"hey everyone , i 'm new to this sub so if this does n't belong here , please forgive me . so my boyfriend and i have been in a primarily long distance relationship for a little over a year , as he 's studying abroad. we skype all the time when we can ( i study at home , online ) and our chemistry is great . we 're pretty open when it comes to sex ( which is amazing ) and we 've talked about trying anal. but whenever we try it hurts a lot and i 've encountered spots of blood later on in the day. we 've tried inserting a finger in my ass , which went well , but upon removal my anus "" froze up "" and would n't budge when he tried to put his penis in. we 've been using lube so it was n't dry sex . my problem is that , he 's coming home in a week or so , and i really want to do this with him. he says he has no problems with us not doing it , and i believe him , but i know that if we do it 'll be pleasantly surprising for him . is there anything i/we can do to make this happen ? so i need to prep at home by myself ? how do i do this ? advice would really be appreciated . tl ; dr : in a ldr , boyfriend comes home in a week , need advice on how to make anal sex happen without it hurting or bleeding . * * edit * * : i probably should add that i 've had anal bleeding before , though it 's only a tiny spot of blood , even when making a bowel movement. this kind of makes me scared as well .",45z3mb,sex,lifestyle,1455574628,stopthenadness,60,0,5,74,0
"i would try using toys bigger than a finger but smaller than your boyfriend 's penis. i like things like butt plugs because they keep you stretched for longer periods of time so you can get used the sensation. they come in a lot of sizes and different materials , and are generally pretty cheap ( especially on amazon ) . i would say take it slow... it does n't sound like you 're quite ready for anal sex , and that 's okay ! take the time to get there. anal sex should n't hurt if it 's done right .",d015yt9,sex,lifestyle,1455574944,IlliterateWit,20,0,93,1678,0

"it 's partially a mental thing ( getting the muscles to relax enough to allow for penetration ) , partially a lube thing , and partially an experience thing. when you start having lots of good experiences , your body just warms up faster. in terms of all of these things , the best thing you can do is to do lots of other stuff before penis time. just because intercourse is now on the table does n't mean it 's the only thing on the menu. if she is feeling pain , back off , apply more lube and outer-play , and wait till she 's begging for you to be inside her. as for the progression from one finger to two , if your finger is pretty coated/drenched and she 's into it , straight up ask her ( in your sexiest voice ) if she 's ready for finger number 2 , but do n't feel you have to rush it. one day it may seem she 's ready for two fingers right away , other days it may seem like forever till she 's ready. that 's normal . i personally say that oral sex is a pretty good go-to move as it can be combined with fingering , adds lube , and is neglected way too often. basically , just go at her pace. the more positive experiences she has in terms of pleasure , the easier it is for her body to respond positively the next time around .",d01j60o,sex,lifestyle,1455595850,need_more_hours,2,0,491,7094,1

yes this is the right size helmet for you. it will certainly compress. 5 years is a long time and it will be compressing the whole time. it is totally normal for the cheeks to be pushed a bit and to get the biting your cheeks feeling. my helmet is like this. only recommendation is like others said maybe check out the padding on the inside but keep the original padding too .,d02uqv3,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455684095,M311o,1,0,432,666,0

"fetish might not be the right word , i was n't sure what else to use. anyway , i 'm male and have mainly identified as heterosexual , but ever since i was little i liked and was aroused by wearing women 's clothing. this itself is pretty common among people , but over the years i 've also become less and less interested in having sex as a man. i 've never had sex , and my fantasies have almost always involved me changed into a woman , or being seen as one. it 's difficult for me to keep myself aroused if i imagine myself as a man having relations with a woman , or with a man either . however , the thought of being a woman , even in non sexual situations , is arousing to me. even picturing myself talking to people and having them see me as a woman is a turn on. this whole thing kind of bothers me. i 'm just wondering if anyone else out there is similar and could share some experiences regarding this. i do n't think i 'm the only person out there with a similar story , i 'm just sort of frustrated with this aspect of myself . also , i obviously dress as a woman a fair bit , which is n't much of a turn on in itself. but , there are times when i see myself as a woman when i check myself out in the mirror , and it makes me feel pretty happy/emotional , on top of some of those feelings of arousal that come from perceiving myself as a woman. this is part of the frustration for me. i 'm just feeling pretty confused about my identity and sexuality , and hope someone can relate and offer some advice or anything. at times i almost wonder if i could be transgender , but the fact that i get aroused and everything just makes it feel like i 'm really just someone who is a little perverted .",46574s,sex,lifestyle,1455664346,skipchaddle,0,0,1,3,0

"how i deal in my mind with the risk of riding my motorcycle . november 12 , 2013 at 3 : 15pm i 'm 57 , got my first bike at 15 and have had 2or3 bikes my whole life so what have i learned. riding a dirt-bike where the speed is slower and traction less so the bike is moving/sliding around under you does help on the street when you hit spilled fuel /sand/leaves or if you get on the power to quick and cause a power slide. as the bike slides you do n't panic as your instincts take over to let the bike slide and recover not panic and crash by being abrupt on the throttle/brakes/steering. ( develop your skills with your machine ) . i have ridden with sport-bikes since 1981 and seen fast rider 's , the one 's who survive approach riding quick by investing in training to develop skill before speed , the other end of the spectrum speeds and gambles they will survive to learn skill , kind of like going all-in at vegas , lot 's crash and burn to die or be horribly crippled. ( approach riding with the winning mind-set of continual training ie ; emergency braking and parking-lot circles and figure 8 's so you transition smooth and brake at maximum. ) . recognize the danger points of street riding , left turners , blind spots , intersections. use the cars around you as blocker 's or pick 's by positioning yourself in the safest spot. recognize the kill-point where the actions of the car can not be avoided by you , if approaching a left-turning vehicle they suddenly accelerate , are you covering the brake , what is the safe spot you steer to , to survive. ( have the safe driving strategy running continually in the back of your mind as you ride. ) for the car 's behind me when i come to a stop , i start braking early to close up the distance behind me and get their attention and i can see if their paying attention by how close they come to me. i then brake smoothly to a stop with my bike in position 1 slightly angles to the left pointing to go past the car in-front of me as my escape route . tire 's are your connection to the road , hard tires last long but if they slide they have little grip , softer tires last 5000-km but are forgiving as they will pull back underneath you in a slide and better grip in the wet , it 's you call , longevity or performance . riding gear is your protection from the road , view it 's purchase as you investing in your own safety and future health and comfort. the other aspect of good gear is if a situation develops you keep your head up and stay in the fight as opposed to freezing with the thought you are crashing and going to be injured . ( confidence that you can survive keeps fear from taking over your conscious mind. ) where i see the difference the right attitude makes is following a experienced rider in traffic versus a new rider . the experienced person is constantly using the traffic around them to optimize their safety in lane position and relative to other cars , while the new rider expects all road user 's to ''respect their right' ' to be on the road . the technique i often use when avoiding the risk of left turners is to use a vehicle in the inside lane as a blocker but doing so puts me in their blind spot. positioned like this hides me from view of the left turner as i am shielded by the car to my left. i recognize that if they change to the center lane it will be uncomfortably close but i expect this so i 'm not upset. i 'm using them . if you hang back 2 -4 car lengths you are still hidden from view of the left turner and now if they accelerate their left turn they will hit you. greater than 5 car lengths and they should see you and you have distance to brake if you turn in-front of you . there are lot 's of scenarios in traffic , if you have a close call it 's best to analyse and develop a strategy to implement as it 's quicker to react than think what your going to do on the spot . how do i view the risk 's of street riding , develop riding skill 's , practice skills , implement traffic survival strategies , buy tires one level above my normal riding style , buy good protective gear .",d02p915,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455674990,GrayMountainRider,1,0,1,5306,0

"top 5 new riders skills we say over and over september 17 , 2012 at 2 : 18pm this year we have seen some very new rider 's advance their skills quickly , i feel in part by being shown the basic skills of road riding and being part of the rides where the conversation is about the finer points the information is easier to relate to , understand and remember. we are not talking trail braking , backing it in or wheelies , we stay with the basic top 5 skill 's that we see new riders need to have . no-1- maintain a comfortable level of focus ( no day dreaming ) , no death grip on the bar 's , keep your arms relaxed , support your weight with your core not your hands. light but firm grip so you feel the steering input and feed-back without transferring all motion into your neck and head , this increases you endurance by not fatiguing any one part of your body . no-2-understand where the corner starts , keep your head up and aim to ride a smooth curve through the whole corner , think of it as distributing the turning stress on the tire 's over the entire corner , maintaining your lane position as you look where you want to go. your peripheral vision is what you use to check your lane position . no-3-in a corner look 2 meters to the inside of the rider in-front of you so you maintain a awareness of the whole corner and your line and not ''use' ' the rider in-front as a reference point. if they drive off the road you do n't want to follow . no-4-no braking in corners , set your speed before the corner , ride the first half steady then a little throttle for the second half as you exit. your tires do ''1' ' thing at a time well , braking to much while leaned over will result in a crash , to much front brake will have the front washing out and toss you in-front of the bike. if the rear brake breaks the rear tire loose the rear of the bike will come around as a low-side also if you let off the rear brake when the back is hung out before the bike is on it 's side , the tire can grab and launch you into a deadly high-side.up over top of the bike . no-5-do n't chase after or push yourself to keep up to anyone , no running red-lights , no cutting off cars to stay with a group , when passing a car wait till you see ''it' ' in your mirror then signal , shoulder check and move over. know where the ride is going so if there is no sweeper you can meet-up at your own pace . a common accident starts with a new rider falling back on a series of corners , then going fast on a straight stretch to catch up , they miss-judge the corner-start and entry speed. they try to make a abrupt correction ( brake or lean ) , realize they are in danger , ''target fixate' ' on a car/rock/ditch/concrete barricade and crash right into the hazard they should avoid . in closing it is reasonable as a new rider to request 1 person stay with you , if you feel riding alone at night on a curvy road will stress you to a point where your abilities to ride your bike will be affected . if no-one in the group is considerate of you personal safety , you are riding with the wrong people , ride at your own pace so you do n't crash or have almost crash 's . after a ride , debrief your ride and think about what went right and what went wrong , what would you do different in a similar situation , it 's easier to implement a pre-planned strategy as opposed to thinking on the spot , what you should do. rarely honking your horn helps , in the moment the car will not react quick enough and your time would be better used to react than signal your displeasure .",d02oywu,motorcycles,lifestyle,1455674561,GrayMountainRider,1,0,1,5306,0

"my girlfriend and i love each other very much. she used to be very turned on by me , and would throw herself onto me whenever we saw each other. but recently she 's stopped wanting to have sex with me or getting turned on by me at all . her reasoning is that she has a fetish — not just a turn-on , but a true can-only-orgasm-by-thinking-about-this-thing fetish. it 's the result of something that happened to her a long time ago. both this past event , as well as the fact she developed a fetish from it , deeply trouble her. because she ca n't orgasm without thinking about it , and thinking about it makes her feel bad , she is afraid to orgasm at all. she has kept this fetish from almost everyone , even her exes. however , one day she told me . i did n't find it strange at all. i found neither the event that caused the fetish nor the fetish itself to be abnormal or bad. although the event itself was a bit unfortunate , it was not uncommon — and certainly nothing along the lines of rape or something terrible like that. i am fairly certain the far majority of people would not find it strange. and yet my girlfriend finds it incredibly strange , and thus bad. this was manageable in the past because she would still enjoy sex with me even if she didn ’ t orgasm. but now she ’ s begun to associate me with the fetish , because i ’ m one of the very few people who knows. when we have sex , or do anything even remotely flirty , all she can think about is the fetish and how she wants it to stop. and so she ’ s found herself more turned on when random guys flirt with her than when her boyfriend does . i can think of two solutions : 1. my girlfriend gets rid of the fetish. my girlfriend made one attempt at this in the past. she didn ’ t orgasm for over a month in hopes she would move on from it and orgasm to typical sex things. but then she tried masturbating , accidentally thought about the fetish for four seconds , and immediately orgasmed and felt terrible about it . 2. my girlfriend stops associating me with the fetish. i don ’ t actually have anything to do with it besides the fact she told me about it. and i don ’ t feel any differently about her now that i know it. but unfortunately you can ’ t easily logic these things away . does anyone have any advice , specifically regarding solution ( 1 ) ? i know people have gotten rid of fetishes in the past. we love each other but dating won ’ t be feasible if she can never get turned on by me again but gets turned on by random guys .",4660lt,sex,lifestyle,1455675912,toucan1000,0,0,1,0,0

"part of an answer i provided recently might be of value to you for this question : &gt ; one of the greatest misunderstanding of pre-conversion european belief systems is grounded on two misunderstandings. the first is that religions do not change. while religions grounded on a written text are tethered to a certain extent , even they change over time. belief systems without a written text change radically over time . &gt ; the second misunderstanding is related to the first , but it specifically involves the anachronistic projection backward in time of an idea of what a religion is in the twenty-first century , applying that understanding of an institution onto a pre-conversion belief system. the result is to see that belief system in an epic struggle with christianity for primacy , and it makes that belief system into something that is monolithic - singular in belief and practice . &gt ; in reality , pre-conversion belief systems were fluid and not monumental. beliefs were certainly different from place to place , from generation to generation , and from person to person. using the analogy of what folklorists observed working with pre-modern european informants and their attitudes toward the fairy faith , for example , beliefs could even change as a person became older. belief systems were extremely difficult to define and describe when they lacked a rigid book and a central "" government "" - for lack of a better word ( referring to the vatican or similar patriarchal locations ) . one of the challenges to answering your question specifically is "" which pagans ? "" and during "" what period ? "" each circumstance was difference , and no circumstance had a consistent universal response on the part of the non-converted community to the monotheistic religion . many romans viewed the eastern mystery religions ( and christianity could be grouped loosely with these ) as creepy cults that subverted good old-fashioned roman values and society. this was in some ways analogous to the way many americans view jehovah witnesses , mormons , or scientologists recognizing that every analogy is flawed and breaks down at some point . many northern europeans apparently viewed christianity with a certain amount of curiosity and awe. pre-conversion belief systems in a pre-literate society were vulnerable to conversion because they were not monolithic , they were amorphous , and they were open to the idea of another supernatural being existing and entering their world - what 's one more , after all ? there was certainly a point when some people would have viewed the new religion as a bit of a cancer since converts too often turned with hostility to the old ways , but this reaction was typically too late to stop the process of change. that said , whenever humanity is faced with change of any sort , the reaction against that change is "" typically too late to stop the process.

"[ this interactive from the * new york times * ] ( http : //www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/08/upshot/how-the-year-you-were-born-influences-your-politics.html ? _r = 0 ) shows you very clearly how people have voted in terms of u.s. presidential elections by birth cohort. confusingly , it shows voter 's simulated preferences based on statistical models even before they 're 18 , which is slightly confusing at glance--just pay attention to what 's going on around the 20 year line. an important note is that this model is for american-born , white people only. as you can see , most cohorts do in general have a higher tendency of voting republican when in middle age and beyond , but that also complex things happen. this particular model ( and this is statistical inference , not exactly how people expressed preferences in surveys ) argues that most people 's preferences are most malleable between 14-24 , and that little that happens after age 40 affects how cohorts vote. one of the more interesting things is that the cohort born roughly during the 1970 's has gotten slightly but consistently * less * likely to vote republican as they age. these people came of age during a period where republicans were triumphant , and chilled a little over time. you can see a slightly similar things in the 1940 's , for people who came of age in the eisenhower era . set the dial to , say , 1974 and notice that this cohort of white americans is less likely to vote republican today than they were when they came of age in 1992. it 's a hard chart to see the ideological splits by age at any particular point in time ( since they are comparing people by at specific ages rather by election ) , but it shows you how cohorts can change over time. what it does n't show you is how much recent voting have been effected by demographic changes , such that bush in 2000 was able to beat al gore among white people 55 % to 42 % , but only barely win the election. compare that to the last close election without a strong third party candidate ( ross perot , you make discussing presidential voting trends more difficult ) , the 1976 election , where carter won 50 % to 48 % , and ford won white people only 52 % to 48 % . hispanics and blacks went very strongly for carter , there were just many fewer hispanics voting. in 1976 , hispanics made up 1 % of voters and blacks made up 9 % . in 2000 , hispanics made up 7 % of voters , blacks made up 10 % , and asians made up 2 % . i know you 're not asking about age , not race , but i feel like it 's important for understanding the above model which is only based on white voters , otherwise the numbers would n't seem to add up ( as a note to this note , bush also did particularly well with hispanic voters , compared to other recent republican candidates , getting close to 40 % of the vote. in a three-man race in 1996 , 73 % of hispanics voted for clinton ) . if you look at the roper center data ( an easy way to look at voting in each election by age group ) , [ you see that 18-24 were more likely to vote for reagan than 25-29 or 30-49 year olds ] ( http : //ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-1984/ ) , though just as likely as 50-64 year olds and less likely than people 65+. according to the above theory , they came of age during reagan 's tremendously popular presidency and so were permanently effected by his high approval ratings , but the effect dissipated slightly over time. you see little peaks and valleys like that--dukkakis and clinton were most popular with the young * and * very old , for example ( perhaps in part due to old southerners continuing to vote democrat as younger cohorts moved more fully into the republican fold--if so , this would be a measure of partisanship rather than ideology--but i am not sure exactly what explains that ) , with a distinct dip in support among the 45-59 year olds . but yes , for the modern polling era , in america , at the presidential level , the general trend is that the young as a whole vote to the left of the old as a whole , even if there are fluctuations within the subgroups. whether you want to say the polling era began in the 1960 's or the 1970 's or even in the 1950 's ( gallup proved the success of telephone polling using random digit dialing in the 1948 "" dewey defeats truman "" election , but i do n't think they collected or at least released subgroup data for that election ) , in the second half 20th century we start to get good data about how subgroups of the population vote. before that period , i 'm not sure it would be easy to tell which way the youth as a whole were voting , though we could see which movements had more youth activists , which is likely a decent proxy , though harder to collect and interpret than already published poll results .",d0136qi,askhistorians,learning,1455570835,yodatsracist,481,0,14317,77599,1

"part of an answer i provided recently might be of value to you for this question : &gt ; one of the greatest misunderstanding of pre-conversion european belief systems is grounded on two misunderstandings. the first is that religions do not change. while religions grounded on a written text are tethered to a certain extent , even they change over time. belief systems without a written text change radically over time . &gt ; the second misunderstanding is related to the first , but it specifically involves the anachronistic projection backward in time of an idea of what a religion is in the twenty-first century , applying that understanding of an institution onto a pre-conversion belief system. the result is to see that belief system in an epic struggle with christianity for primacy , and it makes that belief system into something that is monolithic - singular in belief and practice . &gt ; in reality , pre-conversion belief systems were fluid and not monumental. beliefs were certainly different from place to place , from generation to generation , and from person to person. using the analogy of what folklorists observed working with pre-modern european informants and their attitudes toward the fairy faith , for example , beliefs could even change as a person became older. belief systems were extremely difficult to define and describe when they lacked a rigid book and a central "" government "" - for lack of a better word ( referring to the vatican or similar patriarchal locations ) . one of the challenges to answering your question specifically is "" which pagans ? "" and during "" what period ? "" each circumstance was difference , and no circumstance had a consistent universal response on the part of the non-converted community to the monotheistic religion . many romans viewed the eastern mystery religions ( and christianity could be grouped loosely with these ) as creepy cults that subverted good old-fashioned roman values and society. this was in some ways analogous to the way many americans view jehovah witnesses , mormons , or scientologists recognizing that every analogy is flawed and breaks down at some point . many northern europeans apparently viewed christianity with a certain amount of curiosity and awe. pre-conversion belief systems in a pre-literate society were vulnerable to conversion because they were not monolithic , they were amorphous , and they were open to the idea of another supernatural being existing and entering their world - what 's one more , after all ? there was certainly a point when some people would have viewed the new religion as a bit of a cancer since converts too often turned with hostility to the old ways , but this reaction was typically too late to stop the process of change. that said , whenever humanity is faced with change of any sort , the reaction against that change is "" typically too late to stop the process.

"when historians of pre-modern western civilization , at least , consider "" disability "" and persons with disabilities in history , they typically use a paradigm developed by modern theorists called the "" social model of disability. "" this theory draws a distinction between the material condition of impairment and the social condition of disability . "" impairment "" refers to a deviation from the "" norm "" , be it physical , cognitive , behavioral/psychological , etc. * disability * is the result of impairment in a society that is not equipped to deal with it : the physical and societal barriers to participation in society , negative attitudes , and general exclusion. essentially , it focuses on * public perceptions and social structure * as the defining features of disability , rather than the diagnosis or condition possessed by an individual . while the social model of disability has its modern-day critics ( of course , welcome to the world of critical theory ) , it is enormously useful for historians ! our job is not to reverse-diagnose our subjects. instead , we seek to understand them in the terms of their day . a terrific example of how the social model of disability can be applied to medieval history is 13th century anchoress margaret of magdeburg ( margareta contracta ) . margaret was lame--unable to walk since childhood. but in the flourishing urban piety of 13th century magdeburg , her impairment was perceived as a sign of god 's * grace * , not his judgment of her sin. she found a role for herself as an enclosed anchoress , confined to a single room from which she could watch mass being performed through an internal window and , in the brief moments of her day not devoted to prayer and devotion , offer consolation and guidance to lay inquirers at an external window . margaret was clearly * impaired * . but was she truly * disabled * ? either way you personally want to judge it , she has an important role to play in the history of disability in the middle ages as a marker of what did and did n't count towards "" disability "" under particular circumstances .",d01jiaw,askhistorians,learning,1455596439,sunagainstgold,9,0,1,30000,1
"&gt ; is disability a form of subalternaeity ? i really wish that i had time to write on this properly because it 's a fascinating question , but i 'm just going to offer some brief thoughts . gramsci essentially coined subalternity as being the exclusion from the making of history of one 's own community , which is something he essentially saw as a function of state power ; in postcolonial critical theory , that idea has generally been developed to refer to the condition of being excluded from the dominant power structures of society. spivak has very famously offered the qualifier that one of the defining features of subalternity is that the subaltern 'can not speak ' , in the sense that whatever they try to inscribe into the historical record will always be distorted by the power structures that they are excluded from. the subaltern can be * listened to * by those power structures but it will not be * heard * in the sense that the true meaning of their metaphorical words will be taken up . if we take the social model of disability /u/sunagainstgold talks about as our standard for distinguishing between disability 'proper ' and impairment , then there 's a pretty strong argument to be made that disability is an inherently subaltern characteristic : to be disabled is to have a body or mind that is , in some way , pushed out of the dominant power structure in society. but disability permeates across all lines of class , gender and race ; there is arguably no inherent reason why a disabled person must be * completely * excluded from institutions of power. the argument advanced for excluding an ordinary working class family from subalternity is usually that they have limited but meaningful access to institutions of power in the way that a subaltern underclass does not ( contrast the poor white farmer of the antebellum south with the enslaved plantation worker ) ; can not the same be true of disability ? it is possible for an individual to be disabled in the sense that there are meaningful barriers to their full participation in the power structure without being wholly * excluded * from it . yet perceptions of disability themselves , and what qualifies as disability , can be used as a tool for othering that * creates * a condition of subalternity. consider women who were committed to institutions against their will in the treatment of 'female hysteria ' , a condition that we now know has no legitimacy as a medical diagnosis , but rather represents an attempt to 'medicalise ' ( in retrospect both horrifying and misunderstanding ) quite normal phenomena. in deviating from the ideals of contemporary society they were 'othered ' and could be pushed into a space that , at its extremes , certainly featured the social , cultural and geographic exclusion that can all mark the subaltern condition. but it was not the condition of their body or their mind that excluded them * per se * , it was their gender ; the impairment they were perceived to have was a gendered construct that reflects in some way the precarity of a woman 's position in the hegemonic power structure. neither women nor the differently-abled are inherently subaltern in this particular context - marginalised , yes , but not necessarily excluded in near-totality from the apparatuses that create and disseminate power - but in the intersection of the two , in creating a category of impairment that applied only to women , it became possible to impose a condition of subalternity ( or something closely resembling it ) on women who severely deviated from the norms of behaviour demanded by the elite power structure. the crux of subalternity here lies not in the perception of disability in and of itself but in its gendered construction . conversely though we can also see historical examples of behaviour and traits that we would say today reflect disability that were celebrated in their time. my ( very catholic , for the record ) mother jokes that if christ did come back to earth tomorrow , we would n't know because he 'd end up on a ward in a mental hospital. the historical record is rich with examples of what many people today would consider to be behaviour reflective of a mental/emotional disability or impairment that in their time were celebrated or normalised ( or had the potential to be in a way that they do not today ) . there was an interesting discussion recently on askhistorians about a medieval figure who reported seeing visions , which someone said some scholars had said were likely simply migraines , today recognised as a medical condition that can impair quality of life. another user - whilst disputing the specific diagnosis - also stressed the importance of understanding this particular figure as she would have understood herself. i regret that i can not find that discussion now , but it was an interesting one. i am very weary of anyone who looks back at behaviour legitimised in its own time and tries to impose modern diagnoses upon it : although we can of course say that various medical conditions have always existed , that is not a particularly helpful exercise , and it runs the risk of casting people into roles of passiveness and almost victimhood that they simply did not occupy. when we do that , we risk ourselves speaking * for * the people we study rather than * from * the record . i would say , then , that disability is not inherently subaltern even if it does imply some level of marginality. the way in which disability is * used * and * understood * by contemporary institutions , however , * can * make people subaltern. and here ends my incoherent rambling on historical theory . &gt ; what is essential reading on the topic of bodies and disability ? i push this book every chance that i get but i can not recommend enough the work of dea boster in * african american slavery and disability : bodies , property and power in the antebellum south , 1800 - 1860 * ( 2015 ) - which you can buy on kindle at a really low price for a first academic book. her work is a brilliant and transformative contribution to the scholarship on disability and slavery ; most fascinatingly in my mind , she deals with the way in which disability could even be constructed as a means of resistance and self-empowerment . edit : also , feel free to correct the hell out of any misconceptions i have vis a vis the diagnosis of female hysteria. it just seemed a useful , familiar example for illustrating a theoretical point .",d01s16t,askhistorians,learning,1455621099,sowser,5,0,4,10053,1
"with the rising popularity of disability history people have started approaching eunuchs from this angle.

"" the big problem is that eunuchs in societies that had truly * eunuchs * and not just "" castrated men , "" these people were not seen as merely injured men , they were their own variety of people , with their own appropriate social roles , gender identity , and so on. unlike most people studied under disability studies , they were carefully and ritualistically created , these were no accidental castrations. while castration did disable the body , by removing generative ability , it also changed the body to make it a eunuch , which in many ways gave it "" special powers.

"this coach has been doing it for years and this has been discussed for years. all of these strategies are based on not focusing too much on a single play or drive , but focusing on maximizing points overall in the long run. stat-heads understand it , but football coaches are terrified of that mindset . the 2 point conversion over pat strategy is very simple to understand. a high school kicker is n't going to kick close to 100 % on pats. but high school defenses are n't very good so you 're going to convert more than 50 % of 2 point conversion attempts. you get more points in the long run by always going for 2 . never punting is very popular amongst madden players because video game football tends to be more high scoring ( like high school ) and having 4 plays to get 10 yards as opposed to 3 plays is a massive advantage. if you fail to convert , you 're going to lose more field position than if you punted , but in high scoring games , field position is n't as important as sustaining drives and keeping the ball away from your opponent . this is part of the reason why teams that lose all game can suddenly drive the ball in the last few minutes of games and come from behind , because they 're willing to go for it on 4th down in those scenarios and gain that extra play ( not to mention that defenses play soft in these scenarios which is really stupid , but most coaches do it ) . the onside kick strategy is the one that throws people for a loop. onside kicks fail most of the time. why do something that is destined to fail most of the time ? what happens when it fails ? you lose some field position. in high school the field position difference is n't as much because these high school kickers are n't getting touchbacks. you may lose 20-25 yards of field position on a failed onside , but a successful onside gives you an extra possession while taking one away from your opponent . again , in high scoring high school football when your opponent may score most drives regardless of field position , gaining those extra possessions is huge . when all you do is onside kicks all year , your kicker gets tons of practice at them , and you 'll convert them more than if you only use them in desperation once or twice a year . these strategies absolutely make sense in high school . punting less and always going for 2 might make sense in college . in the nfl , you should punt less but these extremes likely would n't work in the nfl when you have good kickers , but field position matters more and defenses are much better .",d02s1td,todayilearned,learning,1455679420,enderandrew42,1,0,3565,126905,0

"genetic evidence shows that rice ( * oryza sativa * ) was first domesticated in the pearl river delta of china , about 10,000 years ago. the two main varieties today are chinese rice ( * oryza japonica * , which despite its name is chinese and not japanese ) and * oryza indica * , which is mainly grown in india . from china , rice spread quickly to southeast asia and india. the oldest evidence of rice from india dates to about 9,000 years. it was widespread by the time of the indus valley civilization , where it was grown as a staple along with wheat . there is a 3rd variety - * oryza glaberrima * which is thought to have been independently domesticated in west africa about 3500 years ago . rice spread to europe and west asia following alexander ’ s conquests in the 4th century bc. the oldest evidence of rice in europe or west asia is from a grave in susa ( iran ) from the first century bc. from iran it spread westwards into southern europe , where it became fairly common by medieval times. historically , all european rice was derived from * indica * , not * japonica * . in africa , * oryza glaberrima * failed to spread very far. there was some cultivation of this rice in north africa , but * indica * arrived sometime during the first millennium ad , and quickly replaced * glaberrima * . probably the first exposure of arab populations to rice was this * indica * that was grown in parts of north africa , primarily the nile delta. but it was scarce , and remained a small part of their cuisine. it was probably used in the same way as bulghur or couscous - part cooked and granulated for storage , boiled into a porridge or added to meat and vegetables. but wheat and barley dominated ; rice was rare . more extensive use of rice in arab cuisine originates from the mughal rulers of north india , who adapted many north indian rice dishes and persianized them , and spread them to central asia and beyond. you can follow this spread etymologically , for example , the indian * pulao * which is adapted into dozens of varieties of * pilaf * from afghanistan to turkey , all the way to * paella * in spain. muslim empires such as the ottomans spread rice into arab cuisines , but this is relatively recent . it ’ s worth noting that although there are many popular rice dishes in the arab world today , their per capita consumption of rice isn ’ t really that great. on average , people in syria or egypt or lebanon eat about 12 kg per head per year , which has been steadily increasing as rice becomes cheaper and more widely available. it used to be only 5 kg per head per year as late as the 60 ’ s. compare that to predominantly rice-eating cultures like japan , where the per capita consumption is over 100 kg , and you can see that while rice is common in arab cuisine , it isn ’ t really their main staple. rice is more common in * some * parts of the islamic world like iran and afghanistan , but these places are closer to india. the arabs are more at the periphery of rice consumption . an interesting book in this regard is rachel laudan ’ s * [ cuisine and empire ] ( http : //www.amazon.com/cuisine-empire-cooking-world-history/dp/0520266455/ref = tmm_hrd_swatch_0 ? _encoding = utf8&amp ; qid = &amp ; sr = ) * . if you ’ re interested in scholarly papers on rice genetics , i can provide a few references if you want .",d02f8ad,askhistorians,learning,1455659843,EvanRWT,4,0,61,41248,0

"without sitting down and walking through all of solid state physics i 'll just say there are essentially three cuplrits that add up to the total speed : fermi velocity + thermal velocity + drift velocity by far and away the biggest component of an electron in a metal 's velocity is what is called ( 3/5ths of ) their fermi velocity. even at absolute zero electrons have this speed. on average an electron will have 3/5 of what is called the "" fermi energy "" which , if we neglect relativity , might end up being something like about 10 ^ 8 cm/s in a metal. in reality it 's less than that because of various reasons ( relativity , and it feels a kind of "" drag "" from the crystal lattice ) . but the point is it 's huge. ultimately this speed comes from the fact that in quantum mechanics only one electron can have a specific position and momentum. thus once a single electron is in the lowest speed state it hogs it and the next electron has to go into one state higher ( only room for one per state ) and then the next one has to go higher and so on until you have as many electrons as atoms ( or some set electrons per atom depending on the atom ) . thus the very last electron ends up , even at absolute zero , being in quite a high/fast energy state and the "" average "" electron has a speed somewhere in between this top electron and the very lowest energy electron . however , all that speed is organized in a very specific way and has not net motion in any one direction. thus the current it produces is zero . the next biggest effect is temperature , which effectively takes those electrons from their lowest energy state and allows them to go into higher energy states and scatter with one another. on average the extra energy ( and thus speed ) an electron gets from this is about 10 ^ 6 cm/s ( so a hundred times smaller than the fermi speed ) . however , like the fermi speed stuff , there is not net thermal motion in any one direction and thus this does not contribute to a net flow of electrons . finally , coming in at a wopping 10 ^ ( -3 ) cm/s for something like a copper wire is the drift velocity which is the result of the net drift and diffusion these electrons do if the area to their right is at a slightly different potential then their left ( i.e. a voltage is applied across ) . the simplest , and fairly accurate model , for what the speeds of electrons in something like a semiconductor are like is what 's called a maxwellian , and one with a voltage applied is called a "" displaced "" maxwellian. see fig. 2 page 5 of this : https : //nanohub.org/resources/1526/download/choicedistributionfunction_word.pdf the y axis is essentially the amount of electrons and the x-axis is the net velocity they have ( above the fermi velocity ) in a given direction. notice when it 's not displaced that the tails at the end may go out to quite high velocities but it 's irrelevant since it 's symmetric. it 's only when it 's displaced slightly ( and i mean slightly , this cartoon is highly exaggerated ) that electrons make net motion. that is the current .",d01wai4,askscience,learning,1455632994,cantgetno197,1,0,6,4845,0
"the drift velocity is the speed of your average electron the conductor , so yes , it 's the same thing as the speed of an ( average ) electron . electrons do n't travel at uniform speeds. light does , because it 's massless , but an electron is just like you or me : it can be at rest , and it can move at whatever speed you make it ( as long as it 's slower than c , obviously ) . so your first google search is relatively meaningless , since electrons do n't all have a constant speed . &gt ; electrons do n't really travel at the speed of light . not only do the electrons not travel at the speed of light , but the current does n't either. i could n't tell you how fast the current moves , though , since i 'm not exactly an expert . edit : also , the current ( measured in ampere ) is very different from the drift velocity. the current is the number or electrons flowing past a certain point per second , and not the velocity of the electrons . a nice way to visualize it : imagine the conductor is a hallway , and the electrons are people. let 's say you want a current of 5 people/second. if you have lots of people in the hallway ( e.g. copper ) , they can walk past at a leisurely pace. however , if you only have a few people in the hallway , they need to run past to reach 5 per second : a high drift velocity .",d00w6uz,askscience,learning,1455560809,MadTux,1,0,820,14697,0
