"couple questions : -does it say anywhere what plastic the cups are made out of ? like a recycling code or in the manual ? -have they ever gotten hot for any reason ? microwave , dishwasher , boiling water , etc ? -is it localized cloudiness or widespread/even ? i suspect that something induced crystallization in the polymer which unfortunately means you 're probably not going to get it back to the original clarity. essentially whatever plastic the items are made of has a specific glass transition temperature where the polymer chains can start to move again ( not the same as melting ) and if that temperature was exceeded they were able to rearrange into more stable crystallites which are not optically clear. olive oil , vinegar , etc wo n't do anything because the polymer chains themselves have rearranged . if this is indeed what happened , the only chance you 've really got ( and i 'm not sure how feasible this is in a home setting without polymer processing equipment ) is to heat it past the glass transition and then quench cool it super fast so that the crystallites break apart and do n't have enough time to reform before they lose mobility",czlb10h,lifehacks,lifestyle,1454440542,drebunny,15,0,759,5400,

"hi guys ! i 'm not sure if i 'm doing this right... i 've been looking at this subreddit for months now ( just made an account today though ) and i wanted to let you know that you guys inspired me to do this. i 'd always had that idea that other people were skinny and healthy , i was just always going to be fat , but i stumbled across this subreddit one day and it was so inspiring ! it gave me that push i needed to do something about my weight. the dramatic differences people went through , and the time it took... well it helped me realise that even if it was n't done in a day , it could be done , with a bit of hard work ! anyway , i 'd always been super self-conscious about my weight , i was always a tubby girl and i was bullied in school about my weight. in the last couple of years , i packed on the kilos rapidly , i ate way too much and moved way too little , it just made me feel even worse about myself than i already did. i barely left the house and i avoided having photos taken of me or looking in the mirror. i do n't know my exact starting weight because i could n't bring myself to look at the scales , so i put in 81kg , which is about what i weighed after i started seeing a little bit of a physical difference and decided to check my weight . the other day , i looked in the mirror and was happy with what i saw for the first time ! : ) anyway , i 'm not quite finished yet , my goal weight is still a ways to go , and after i lose the last few kilos , i 'm going to start with strength training , to build up some abs , but i thought i 'd post what i 'd done so far so that i could feel proud of my achievements . if anyone wants to know how i did it , it was pretty easy ! i used myfitnesspal , restricted my calories without giving up the foods i loved , and joined a gym just to help speed up the process. it took months and it was weeks until i saw any progress but if there 's anyone out there thinking of losing weight and getting healthier , do n't worry ! that first bit of progress is worth the weeks of nothing happening ! it 's almost addictive ! i 'm so much more social and outgoing now , i feel healthier , more active , and finally i feel like i can be the person i want to be ! so thanks , progresspics , i really owe it to everyone on here. i still look up progress albums daily to keep me going , and i hope maybe my photos can do the same for someone else !",czyesqi,progresspics,lifestyle,1455368043,cinnamonbrook,14,0,103,11,

"i 'm 25lbs down ( 169 this morning ! ) , and still have another 15 to go - aiming for 155. i 'm enjoying seeing and feeling the difference in my body ! from the outset my goal has been to lose weight slowly and steadily by trying to take in the amount of calories a person of my ideal ht/wt should. i knew that would mean slower progress , but it would also mean getting accustomed to a certain style of eating over time , which could possibly mean less chance of regaining it all later. when i first started mid-september , i used mfp religiously. at this point i do n't use it very often , and instead keep a loose running total in my head , and monitoring my activity with my fitbit. i still look foods up on mfp when i add something novel to my diet , or when i forget the specifics of a certain food. i 've found that strict calorie counting ( using mfp , for instance ) has tradeoffs for me. i do find that i lose weight faster and more predictably - which is great. but , i also find i can start to feel quite defeated and frustrated when i count everything every day...mostly because i sometimes feel like my weight and weight loss gets to own so much of my life. i think for some people it 's quite empowering to take back control from food by logging it ; for me it feels the opposite , like the process of weight loss gets to be a bigger , more defining part of me than i 'm comfortable with. so , i 've decided i 'm ok not doing it all the time , but i do check in regularly to make sure my loose estimate is accurate enough to be worth doing . in terms of changes i 've made to eating/lifestyle : 1. keto since mid-september : this has definitely changed my body 's needs/cravings for food , and how i view food. i still love the experience of food , but i can appreciate it now without having to go crazy. it 's fuel , and also social , and also an experience , but mostly fuel . * since about mid-december i 've started doing intermittent fasting ( if ) , though i do it more loosely than some do. i usually have a fatty breakfast ( 2 eggs , a credit-card sized filet of salmon , half an avocado , and a smidge of either cream cheese or sour cream ) . then i eat nothing but coffee with cream/half and half until dinner , which is usually around 6-8pm. i find that fasting on keto is so much easier than skipping meals when i 'm eating lots of carbs. my blood sugar is level , so while some days i 'll notice the absence of food , most days i do n't . * started c25k in december . * more generally , i 'm more purposeful in exercise. i was already exercising a fair bit ( 3-6 half-hour walks a day with the dog , plus rock climbing during the week ) . in early december i got a fitbit , and it has been a really fun way to keep track of my exercise. i 've tried to just up my exercise slowly. now a typical week includes about 4 morning dog walks , 3 half-hour runs in the neighborhood ( c25k has been great ! ) , and 2 hour-long rock climbing workouts at the gym. since the beginning of january i 've also been trying to incorporate more strength training using the sworkit app 2x a week for equipment free workouts. i use it for lower body , arms , and abs , slowly increasing how much time i do each. for example right now i can do about 10/5/6 minutes each on those using that app. i recommend it , though it has some clunky parts . so yeah , 25lbs down , 15 to go...i 'm excited to have passed a new decade on the scale , and i 've found this community very helpful and inspiring. thanks for letting me lurk !",czxpcz3,progresspics,lifestyle,1455308154,depenguinate,3,0,86,320,

"i 'm 25lbs down ( 169 this morning ! ) , and still have another 15 to go - aiming for 155. i 'm enjoying seeing and feeling the difference in my body ! from the outset my goal has been to lose weight slowly and steadily by trying to take in the amount of calories a person of my ideal ht/wt should. i knew that would mean slower progress , but it would also mean getting accustomed to a certain style of eating over time , which could possibly mean less chance of regaining it all later. when i first started mid-september , i used mfp religiously. at this point i do n't use it very often , and instead keep a loose running total in my head , and monitoring my activity with my fitbit. i still look foods up on mfp when i add something novel to my diet , or when i forget the specifics of a certain food. i 've found that strict calorie counting ( using mfp , for instance ) has tradeoffs for me. i do find that i lose weight faster and more predictably - which is great. but , i also find i can start to feel quite defeated and frustrated when i count everything every day...mostly because i sometimes feel like my weight and weight loss gets to own so much of my life. i think for some people it 's quite empowering to take back control from food by logging it ; for me it feels the opposite , like the process of weight loss gets to be a bigger , more defining part of me than i 'm comfortable with. so , i 've decided i 'm ok not doing it all the time , but i do check in regularly to make sure my loose estimate is accurate enough to be worth doing . in terms of changes i 've made to eating/lifestyle : 1. keto since mid-september : this has definitely changed my body 's needs/cravings for food , and how i view food. i still love the experience of food , but i can appreciate it now without having to go crazy. it 's fuel , and also social , and also an experience , but mostly fuel . * since about mid-december i 've started doing intermittent fasting ( if ) , though i do it more loosely than some do. i usually have a fatty breakfast ( 2 eggs , a credit-card sized filet of salmon , half an avocado , and a smidge of either cream cheese or sour cream ) . then i eat nothing but coffee with cream/half and half until dinner , which is usually around 6-8pm. i find that fasting on keto is so much easier than skipping meals when i 'm eating lots of carbs. my blood sugar is level , so while some days i 'll notice the absence of food , most days i do n't . * started c25k in december . * more generally , i 'm more purposeful in exercise. i was already exercising a fair bit ( 3-6 half-hour walks a day with the dog , plus rock climbing during the week ) . in early december i got a fitbit , and it has been a really fun way to keep track of my exercise. i 've tried to just up my exercise slowly. now a typical week includes about 4 morning dog walks , 3 half-hour runs in the neighborhood ( c25k has been great ! ) , and 2 hour-long rock climbing workouts at the gym. since the beginning of january i 've also been trying to incorporate more strength training using the sworkit app 2x a week for equipment free workouts. i use it for lower body , arms , and abs , slowly increasing how much time i do each. for example right now i can do about 10/5/6 minutes each on those using that app. i recommend it , though it has some clunky parts . so yeah , 25lbs down , 15 to go...i 'm excited to have passed a new decade on the scale , and i 've found this community very helpful and inspiring. thanks for letting me lurk !",czxpcz3,progresspics,lifestyle,1455308154,depenguinate,3,0,86,320,

"[ before &amp ; after ] ( http : //m.imgur.com/a/igytu ) i posted in r/loseit but i thought i would come here and share my story because i love hearing and seeing everyone 's stories about being healthy and losing weight . mine basically started with the fact that i have depression. which is something that i 've always had to deal with and always will. but around the end of 2014 i had just turned 21 and i realized that i ca n't change the way that i feel but a lot of the reasons that i feel so shitty is because i 'm overweight . i hated how i could n't fit into any stylish clothes , just sweats and 2xl t-shirts from walmart. i know that that sounds vain and conceited but i literally have a closet full of shit that i could n't fit into anymore. i hated how i could n't go outside. one of those pics i 'm in is when i was in hawaii and i was miserable the whole time and barely left the hotel room. i hated how food was my only comfort and realized that that 's not a very healthy way to live life . around christmans time i decide to change with baby steps. i cut out things in my diet that were unhealthy but i know i would n't miss. for instance i never had had much of a sweet tooth so sugar was the first thing to go. and then i cut out alcohol. within the first month i lost 25-30 pounds right there. then i cut out red meat , which did wonders for my energy. i also started walking everywhere. work/school/shopping , and after i stereo losing weigh those walks turned into power walks which turned into jogs which turned into slow runs , you get the picture. after about half way through the year i started taking up a ton of combat sports such as boxing , kick boxing and jiu jitsu. i 've always loved mma and it 's amazing what all of those ( boxing especially ) did for my muscle and weight loss. really toned up my shoulders as well . i started to use my nutribullet and adding kale to my diet. i hated it at first but when you blend it with fruit and other things you do n't notice it and it 's so good for you . just baby steps. losing weight got really fun towards the end and it was nice to go outside with out a shirt on .

"i was tired of each day being a flurry of todo 's bouncing around in my head. i was also mortified at the days when i stumbled across large pockets of free time , and dicked around on the internet instead of using that precious time constructively . enter the scheduling system. i 've been using this method for the last few months , and it has rocked my world. i 'm getting more stuff done , and more importantly , planning for free time and using it constructively. the best part is that it 's very simple . * * if you find stuff like this helpful , please consider signing up for my mailchimp list to be notified when new articles go up. i write about no-bs strategies to improve your daily hustle : http : //hackthegrind.net/subscribe/ * * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ # scheduling the day : a productivity method for entrepreneurs . until recently , i didn ’ t have a productivity system. i didn ’ t really need one - there was always work that needed doing , and i had various side projects to fill out the time. i was always pretty comfortable flowing from one task to another . but , letting my tasklist run the day had downsides. work expanded to fill the amount of time i had , meaning that i could increase my free time without increasing productivity. also , those side projects i pursued in my vanishing free time weren ’ t going anywhere . my tasklist dictated my time , but in a haphazard , thoughtless way. when i had something in front of me - especially with a deadline - i attacked it. but i lacked direction when there was no urgent problem to solve. i was great at bottoms-up execution , but not so great at top-down management . then i returned to consulting , and with it , multiple clients , complex projects and numerous deliverables , i also renewed my commitment to making serious progress on side projects. the “ flow ” wouldn ’ t do. i needed a system . # # tl ; dr : the scheduling system is basically a fusion of tasklist , project tracker and calendar into one entity. every night , i review outstanding tasks and ongoing projects , and i schedule them to available timeslots. completed tasks are checked off and disappear ; those that get missed are rescheduled at the next planning session. i try and fill in the entire day with appointments , even if they ’ re just “ go for a walk ” or “ travel to client. ” * * it works because scheduled things get done. * * the scheduling discipline has increased the number of tasks i complete each day and helped me make meaningful , sustained progress on larger projects. i ’ m much better at prioritizing , because the discipline brings my tasklist to bear against the reality of limited working hours . the scheduling discipline equips me with a plan for using my time well. it ’ s like eating healthy. if you “ try to eat healthier ” from whatever ’ s in front of you , you won ’ t do as well as someone who commits to a diet through grocery shopping and meal prep. one is aspiration , the other is a plan . the scheduling discipline works even when i don ’ t follow the actual schedule , which is nearly 100 % of the time. scheduling merely sets the goalpost. going off track doesn ’ t change the fact that i ’ ve prioritize what i need to do and committed to do it , which is the real struggle . here ’ s how i do it . # # tools : note - this is obviously for a mac setup. i ’ m sure you can find analogs for pc/android , i just don ’ t know what they are . * fantastical 2 , desktop and iphone apps. the os x calendar on steroids. has a lot of nice features , but the most critical is that it represents your reminders on a calendar . * iphone with siri and reminders. my system works only if it ’ s super-easy to enter new appointments and reminders . * icloud account ( for easy syncing between everything ) . # # the process 1. throughout the day , i save new tasks as reminders with a tentative timeframe attached. i usually dictate into my phone or type it into fantastical 2 ( “ remind me to call the dentist tomorrow morning ” ) . i always schedule tasks for a general time like “ tomorrow afternoon ” or “ friday morning ” . it gets moved to the right time in the nightly scheduling . 2. each night , i review and schedule tasks. this 10-15 minute ritual is the last thing i do in the work day. first , i pull up the calendar in fantastical , and drag all my unchecked reminders to open slots. simple stuff like phone calls and quick emails can all go into the same slot , to be handled in sequence , while a longer project will get its own slot . 3. in that same nightly review , i schedule the day ’ s activities. i use one primary account ( icloud calendar ) and put blocks down for projects , workouts , transit time , prep time for appointments , phone calls , meditation , meals and whatever else i want to accomplish . 4. during the day , i stick to the calendar when possible. i have it running constantly and try to address tasks and project work in the time its scheduled for . 5. but i don ’ t worry if the schedule gets blown up. sometimes i get taken off track by something important. other days , i ’ m not nearly as enthusiastic about the work i committed to , and i blow it off to get a massage or play insurgency. it ’ s like eating pizza after a hard training session ; discipline earns you guilt-free slacking. that night , i honestly account for what i did and didn ’ t do , and push things back accordingly . # # an example here ’ s a heavily simplified use case. a client has given me a project with two discrete items ; a task to check in with someone , and a hour of actual work to do . [ click here to see diagram ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/zbgntfp.png ) # # the benefits * * * doing all the planning in one session reduces mental strain. * * an unstructured task list makes your brain work every time you look at it. prioritizing tasks , estimating time/labor and thinking about when to do each item. batching the planning conserves mental calories for the actual work . better follow-through on tasks. scheduling things improves the chance they ’ ll get done , period - even if i don ’ t actually do them on the schedule. it seems nutty to schedule meditation , for instance , but i always seem to find time for it when i schedule it in . * * * free time is anticipated and used. * * i used to stumble over pockets of free time , and when i found them , i didn ’ t know what to do with myself. now , i fill wide-open spaces with productive uses of energy . * * * planning around my natural energy levels. * * i can block out time for big projects in the morning , schedule email replies after lunch , and generally anticipate what i ’ ll be best at . * * * better prepped and more polished. * * scheduling time to prep for meetings ensures that i walk into those meetings with the right documents , talking points and questions. even five minutes can mean the difference between a great meeting and a poor one . # # important caveats * * * this is not about being a robot. * * the schedule is a guide , not strict ; i prepare it as though i ’ ll stick to it , but i rarely stay 50 % on track. think of it this way : my natural productivity is about a c+. with this system , i plan for an a+ , and in executing wind up around a b/b+ . * * * this is not about “ manager ’ s schedule ” . * * my schedule includes huge blocks of time for writing sessions and other creative projects. the only parts of the day with micromanaged tasks are usually after lunch and the afternoon . * * * this is not about squeezing productivity from every second of the day. * * i actually relax more now , because my improved productivity opens up more time for long walks , cooking dinner and all the other things that make life fun. i generally schedule only between 8am and 4pm , and leave weekends completely clear . * * if you find stuff like this helpful , please consider signing up for my mailchimp list to be notified when new articles go up. i write about no-bs strategies to improve your daily hustle : http : //hackthegrind.net/subscribe/ * *",445jnp,lifehacks,lifestyle,1454597266,jpreeves,128,0,2367,6220,

"this was a persistent issue for us for a year. we tried everything out there - humane traps , classic traps , poison , peppermint oil , those sonic things you plug in to the wall and more. could n't stand it anymore and this is how we succeeded : be incredibly thorough and go around the entire perimeter of your inside walls and examine the area where the skirting board and carpet/wood meet. look for any gaps ( think way smaller than the mouse holes in cartoons ! ) like anywhere you could stick your finger down and especially areas with a lot of droppings. if you find any you must seal them up with a filler from a diy store. we also reenforced the bigger gaps with home made metal barriers that can not be chewed through ( just bent an old biscuit tin ) . we pulled out the dishwasher in the kitchen and found a big gap leading to the inside of the walls. once we blocked this off we never saw another mouse . also , if you do n't already , get a tall bin for your kitchen that closes properly so they ca n't smell the food. keep all your food in containers with lids. doing all of this is more effective than using traps as it prevents the mice in the first place ! good luck",czu41mq,lifehacks,lifestyle,1455062433,smallbluecat,1,0,403,434,
"pest control technician here . first thing you are going to do is make sure your roof is sealed and that there are no branches from trees hanging over your house. rats and squirrels will use those to get onto your roof . you 're going to want to check your roof for any and all kind of entrances. your exhaust vents should all have screens. if your attic has a vent or a fan , it needs a screen. check the corners , underneath eaves , where the roof may meet and create a pocket with another section of roof. you 're looking mainly for holes or crevices they could scurry into. ( remember , if the hole is only as big as their head , they can fit. ) the best way to identify if rats are using an area to get in and out of the house is to look for brown stains. they piss uncontrollably and it leaves a dark brown and sometimes black "" run "" alone the base of their entrance ways. google will be your friend when needing image examples for this . next you are going to want to check your decks if you have any. underneath is where they like to chew holes into your house. you 're going to have to seal it up with chain or lattice work if you want to keep them out for good . now , it 's time for trapping. you 're going to want to place your traps in areas that the rats are going to start searching for food. it 's tricky , but a few google searches should set you in the right direction. i , unfortunately , would need to see your house to know exactly where to put the traps . but you need to know this - putting traps out when the house is still exposed to entrances and exits will be a waste of time. sealing the house cuts off their food , which means they will start searching within the house and be desperate for whatever is on the trap . good luck to you. if you need any more info just shoot me a message . edit : spelling",czudxg0,lifehacks,lifestyle,1455077228,StormrayVoice,1,0,957,231,

"my dad used to work for a vending machine company , and as a little kid , i got to tag along every once in a while when i had no school ( whether intentional or not ; ] ) . i got soda and snacks all day long , to my heart 's content. after all , chips , sodas , etc. come in huge boxes , and one missing is not gon na warrant some sort of scandal ( i think my dad 's boss expected his workers to have one every once in a while , i mean , who would n't ) . always an awesome little joyride , as long as i brought my gameboy along for the boring and sometimes long rides between stops . anyways , over time , there was a little trick i learned with the machines , particularly drinks machines. if you 've ever look inside one , you 'll realize that there are something like 10-12 soda columns where the cans lie flat , with like 3 cans per row , just like [ this ] ( https : //eddieleephotography.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/insidecokemachine.jpg ) . on certain machines , however , there are sometimes as little as 7 or 8 buttons for rows. my little kid brain realized this discrepancy , paid attention , and noticed some things . these are the older machines. you 'll spot one of these 'standard ' machines by the locking mechanism. it uses a [ circular key lock ] ( http : //www.padlocks4less.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/m/e/mei-2400as_left_tilt_keys.jpg ) that pops out a lever. the lever unscrews , and the fridge doors open. yes , doors. there are two. the first door/panel with the light bars , electronics , money counting and receiving mechanism , and then a well insulated door to keep the soda cool and separate from the electronic computer. back to the first panel , behind the panel door is the mechanism that counts exact amounts of money entered , exact amounts of sodas or snacks dispensed , total sales , etc. my dad recorded it all on a clipboard with serial numbers , and if there was ever a sort of problem , a technician would be sent to the machine to check it out . but here 's the thing. my little 8/9 year old brain carefully noticed something particular. and like i said , if you never looked inside these machines , you 'd never know there were sometimes more columns of soda than buttons. here 's where you can hack the machine . it 's a sort of careful progress , so if it does n't happen the first time , you can try again. sometimes , there 's no way of knowing 100 % if it worked , but i 've noticed that it 's common with those older machines. look for a machine that prices their sodas at a little bit more than a dollar , say , $ 1.25. now get a dollar , and put it in. just a dollar. and press your soda. it will try to register as a sale , but because you do n't have enough , it will not dispense the soda. get change. the computer now registered a failed attempt , but nothing else. take the same dollar , and try the next soda. once again , another non-registered fail. attempt at purchase , no dispensed soda. take your change again. try it once each with all the buttons. you 've gone through the first 8 or so columns of soda , * but not the last few ones. * go and get the extra money you need to purchase a 'regular priced ' soda from one of the buttons. in this case , you would deposit $ 1.25. now that the 'transaction ' is open , hit the soda you want. now , like i said , it might not work out the first time ( after all , there 's no way of looking inside the machine without the key ) . if it does n't work out , try it again. but if you did everything the way i wrote it out and it worked fine , you will have gotten a soda , not from one of the main columns , but one of the extra reserve columns. walk away , open that sum'bitch up , and enjoy it. you just got an 'extra reserves ' soda . tl : dr neat little trick to get a soda that is not visibly registered for purchase on a machine. if all else fails , just ask the damn soda machine guy about the money it ate up. about 9/10 times , he 'll just give you a free soda to get you off his back so he can finish his job. for him , it 's the most trivial part of getting back to the warehouse and clocking out for the weekend . edit : a word",czp1bb9,lifehacks,lifestyle,1454694465,Liquid_Vine,10,0,163,1142,

"march 2015 : http : //imgur.com/ecmkthw edit * february 2016 : http : //imgur.com/efutvar recently started taking my cut really seriously to look good for spring break and summer and wanted to post results . to contextualize : i 'm a college senior who 's been lifting since high school. i used to go really hard with athletic builds ( squats squats squats ) , but i now do more of a bro/ppl split - though i have never tracked my progress on paper. terrible i know , but i 'm at a point in my life where going to the gym every day before classes is enjoyable and helps maintain a great mindset and adrenaline rush. i do n't feel a need to formally track progress . i entitled this the alcohol cut because my current lifestyle entails frequent partying , going out , enjoying life. i had an idea of intermittent fasting and calorie counting in the before pic , but i had just let the weekends get out of hand. one thing i realized looking at the before pics is that when i let myself go , i 'd rationalize it in my head in one ridiculous way or another . this summer i went on a vacation , saw pics of myself , and decided i was n't gon na let myself get any heavier. i embarked on a cut , knowing in advance i would hit road bumps , food binges , weekends at the bar , tuesdays at the bar , etc . for the past month or so i 've dieted down to ~ 1400 kcal/day , knowing that while this is too low to maintain a productive metabolism , that i make up for it while drinking 3-4 nights a week. and sorry , but it 's not exactly drinking in moderation . this may not be the most ideal , the most productive or the most efficient way to get shredded , but i plan on taking it farther into the low 150s/high 140s and lean-gaining from there .",46675d,progresspics,lifestyle,1455678388,MSL_VT2016,9,0,49,87,

"my journey began on april 4 , 2015. i had extremely bad lower back pain , anxiety attacks , slight chest pains , i kept rubbing holes in the crotch of my jeans , i was depressed , my boyfriend and i fought all of the time , and i ate until i was physically ill . i finally decided to make a change and become a better me. i downloaded myfitnesspal , began working out at the gym , and 11 months later here i am. i 'm not happy that it took so long , but dammit i 'm proud i 'm here . i had a few slip ups. in may i came down with a kidney infection. if anyone here has dealt with that , you 'll know exactly why i fell off of the wagon. it was probably the most painful week i 've ever dealt with. in august , i went on a cruise for a week and went into full party mode. and over the holidays , i 'll admit i was really relaxed with my eating . for the most part however , i ate between 1200-1500 calories a day. mostly turkey , chicken or fish. i ate red meats rarely because they were so much more expensive and higher calorie. i began drinking protein shakes for breakfast or i would have an egg , two slices of bacon , toast or hash browns for breakfast if i had the time. for lunch , i would have some sort of sandwich , grapes , apple , banana , cheese stick , whatever i was in the mood for . during this journey , i realized how easy it is to find low calorie things if you actually give a crap and try. i quit making excuses for myself , got my mindset out of the fatlogic , and got my butt into gear . my lower back pain is gone , i no longer have chest pains , my jeans do n't rub holes , i weight lift and i 'm working towards jogging my first 5k ! also , my boyfriend and i are much better and happier and he has now began getting into shape himself . thank you for taking the time to check out my post !",d00rve2,progresspics,lifestyle,1455554467,SwinginCrabWhacka,33,0,566,15176,

"march 2015 : http : //imgur.com/ecmkthw edit * february 2016 : http : //imgur.com/efutvar recently started taking my cut really seriously to look good for spring break and summer and wanted to post results . to contextualize : i 'm a college senior who 's been lifting since high school. i used to go really hard with athletic builds ( squats squats squats ) , but i now do more of a bro/ppl split - though i have never tracked my progress on paper. terrible i know , but i 'm at a point in my life where going to the gym every day before classes is enjoyable and helps maintain a great mindset and adrenaline rush. i do n't feel a need to formally track progress . i entitled this the alcohol cut because my current lifestyle entails frequent partying , going out , enjoying life. i had an idea of intermittent fasting and calorie counting in the before pic , but i had just let the weekends get out of hand. one thing i realized looking at the before pics is that when i let myself go , i 'd rationalize it in my head in one ridiculous way or another . this summer i went on a vacation , saw pics of myself , and decided i was n't gon na let myself get any heavier. i embarked on a cut , knowing in advance i would hit road bumps , food binges , weekends at the bar , tuesdays at the bar , etc . for the past month or so i 've dieted down to ~ 1400 kcal/day , knowing that while this is too low to maintain a productive metabolism , that i make up for it while drinking 3-4 nights a week. and sorry , but it 's not exactly drinking in moderation . this may not be the most ideal , the most productive or the most efficient way to get shredded , but i plan on taking it farther into the low 150s/high 140s and lean-gaining from there .",46675d,progresspics,lifestyle,1455678388,MSL_VT2016,9,0,49,87,

"[ imgur ] ( https : //imgur.com/a/ctajn ) the first picture is on my wedding day , in august 2014. i 'm not sure how much i weighed then , but i think i was probably hovering between 240lbs and 245lbs. i had n't stepped on a scale in who knows how long , and was pretty deep in denial about my weight. i do remember that it was a struggle to get the dress done up ; i had to suck in to get the zipper up , and most of that day was pretty physically uncomfortable. having professional pictures done on the beach for over an hour while slogging through sand was a * nightmare * . the second picture was taken a few days ago - i decided to try my dress on again to see if there was a difference. well... there 's now a sizeable gap in the bust , and when i lifted my arms up , the dress fell right down ! i was shocked , haha . i decided to start losing weight in august 2015 , and my official sw is 236lbs. it 's been slow going ; i have n't been as strict with counting calories as i should be ( but i 've started keeping a closer eye on my intake again ; i 'm aiming for my first goal of 180lbs by june ! ) . it * has * been coming off though - 27lbs since september ! it 's not a huge amount of progress yet ( and i still have a long way to go ) , but i 'm slowly getting there. i 've been having issues seeing any difference in the mirror , but the dress really helped re-affirm that i 'm headed in the right direction. i ca n't wait to see the end results !",461jh0,progresspics,lifestyle,1455610609,YouCussingWithMe_,64,0,1,40,

"i was told i should post this here i started at 360 a little less than a year ago after years of gaining weight and not recognizing myself in mirrors. i wore size 5x shirts and 52waist , i now wear large shirts and 34 waist. i joined a healthy lifestyle program at my local hospital. i did n't have much hope for it but i thought if i was going to do i would be the best. i lost 16lb the first two weeks. i looked at if like beating a highs ore i wanted to have lost more each meeting than the last. i was losing about 5 pounds a week ( 20 a month ) . i did so well my doctors want to use me as the poster child for their program. i have given a couple speeches at medical conferences and i am currently working with a group of kids that are still in the program. i just started a weight loss program at my school with the help of my doctors. i want to show that anyone can lose weight and you do n't need to take pills or get surgery ( unless absolutely necessary of coarse ) to lose weight. i remember seeing the p90x type commercials thinking that it was impossible for me to do. i want to show people that anyone can change , i got so socially uncomfortable i pulled out of public school for two years. i would go weeks without talking to anyone and it ruined my social skills. but now i give speeches to groups of doctors and other kids in programs similar to my . one thing i try and tell people who ask me how i did is that you do n't have to work yourself to death everyday. of coarse it wo n't be easy. i started of just eating right and walking. i then moved to working on my bowflex and now i focus are cardio which is my favorite. i only eat fruits meats and vegetables. i lowered my carb intake but that can be dangerous because your body needs carbs. so i stick with rice. i eat fruits whenever i get a sweet tooth sense they are natural sweeteners. i have very little dairy intake. my diet is very important because of my medical issues. at my largest i was at the threat of getting thyroid cancer a swell as gynecomastia ( which is very painful ) . the leg pain i was referring to was osgood shlaters , the tendon in the knee pulls apart after to much running. now i have no signs of cancer and only take one pill for the gynecomastia ( i took 4 for 6 months ) . the photo on the right is a month old about 15 pounds , i do n't like taking photos . sorry for typing so much. feel free to ask any questions .

"make sure to switch your dryer circuit on your fuse box to off and unplug the dryer . open the door to your dryer and you should see two screws on the upper corners of door recess on the front panel , this will allow you to lift off and remove the top panel of the dryer . now you will see one screw in each of the upper inside edges of the dryers front panel , remove those and the front panel will be free. put this forward and it will release itself from the drum of the dryer . the lip that the dryer drum was resting on is where you will see the dryer bearings. they are plastic ( same as the nalgene bottle ) or teflon tabs that are about 1cmx6cm in size with a hole on the right side and both ends tucked into the plastic housing. if your dryer is squeaky , one or more of these bearings are worn through and you have metal on metal contact ( hence the squeaking ) . [ here is a picture of where the dryer bearings are located. ] ( http : //imgur.com/gallery/ej3fo96 ) [ here is a picture of what the bearings look like ] ( http : //imgur.com/scerexx ) take your nalgene bottle ( the old milky white ones with the blue lid , not the newer hard shatterproof ones ) and use some heavy scissors to cut a strip of the bottle that is wide enough that it will just barely fit into the slots on the lip where the bearings go. drill or puncture a hole in the strip so that both sides tuck into the slots and the hole catches the little prong. repeat with all worn bearings . now you can stick your hand into the inside of the dryer barrel and lift the front end back onto the lip where the bearings are and close the dryer in the reverse of the order you took it apart . enjoy dry clothes without the horrible squeaking . also , if the lip where the bearings are located is broken to the point where you can not install new bearings , you can order a new bearing unit online for a few bucks and extend the life of your dryer . cheers .",45v5wk,lifehacks,lifestyle,1455517063,docshultz,3,0,159,7958,

i just started keto about 5 weeks ago and i saw a change. eating right became obsessive for me and in doing so i 've already lost 12 lbs. but then super bowl weekend happened and now valentines day. i feel like i 've found a small way to cheat every night. i know it 's been wrong and i wo n't get anywhere doing so. i started where you did : 275lbs at 5'6. but seeing your progress and dedication makes me want the right way again. thank you for your honesty and for sharing your amazing progress. great job !,czzy93w,progresspics,lifestyle,1455485907,CHI_not_so_CHI,1,0,1,8,

"i 'm 25lbs down ( 169 this morning ! ) , and still have another 15 to go - aiming for 155. i 'm enjoying seeing and feeling the difference in my body ! from the outset my goal has been to lose weight slowly and steadily by trying to take in the amount of calories a person of my ideal ht/wt should. i knew that would mean slower progress , but it would also mean getting accustomed to a certain style of eating over time , which could possibly mean less chance of regaining it all later. when i first started mid-september , i used mfp religiously. at this point i do n't use it very often , and instead keep a loose running total in my head , and monitoring my activity with my fitbit. i still look foods up on mfp when i add something novel to my diet , or when i forget the specifics of a certain food. i 've found that strict calorie counting ( using mfp , for instance ) has tradeoffs for me. i do find that i lose weight faster and more predictably - which is great. but , i also find i can start to feel quite defeated and frustrated when i count everything every day...mostly because i sometimes feel like my weight and weight loss gets to own so much of my life. i think for some people it 's quite empowering to take back control from food by logging it ; for me it feels the opposite , like the process of weight loss gets to be a bigger , more defining part of me than i 'm comfortable with. so , i 've decided i 'm ok not doing it all the time , but i do check in regularly to make sure my loose estimate is accurate enough to be worth doing . in terms of changes i 've made to eating/lifestyle : 1. keto since mid-september : this has definitely changed my body 's needs/cravings for food , and how i view food. i still love the experience of food , but i can appreciate it now without having to go crazy. it 's fuel , and also social , and also an experience , but mostly fuel . * since about mid-december i 've started doing intermittent fasting ( if ) , though i do it more loosely than some do. i usually have a fatty breakfast ( 2 eggs , a credit-card sized filet of salmon , half an avocado , and a smidge of either cream cheese or sour cream ) . then i eat nothing but coffee with cream/half and half until dinner , which is usually around 6-8pm. i find that fasting on keto is so much easier than skipping meals when i 'm eating lots of carbs. my blood sugar is level , so while some days i 'll notice the absence of food , most days i do n't . * started c25k in december . * more generally , i 'm more purposeful in exercise. i was already exercising a fair bit ( 3-6 half-hour walks a day with the dog , plus rock climbing during the week ) . in early december i got a fitbit , and it has been a really fun way to keep track of my exercise. i 've tried to just up my exercise slowly. now a typical week includes about 4 morning dog walks , 3 half-hour runs in the neighborhood ( c25k has been great ! ) , and 2 hour-long rock climbing workouts at the gym. since the beginning of january i 've also been trying to incorporate more strength training using the sworkit app 2x a week for equipment free workouts. i use it for lower body , arms , and abs , slowly increasing how much time i do each. for example right now i can do about 10/5/6 minutes each on those using that app. i recommend it , though it has some clunky parts . so yeah , 25lbs down , 15 to go...i 'm excited to have passed a new decade on the scale , and i 've found this community very helpful and inspiring. thanks for letting me lurk !",czxpcz3,progresspics,lifestyle,1455308154,depenguinate,3,0,86,320,

[ my 40th birthday ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/uhdsswo.jpg ) . i weighed 441 pounds . 1. in january 2014 i told myself that if i could give up diet pepsi , i 'd look into the surgery. my last soda was 1/1/14 . 2. in january 2015 , i made an appointment with my primary care doctor. before he had ( rightly ) refused to recommend me to the bariatric surgery program because he did n't think i was ready mentally. i told him of my efforts to stop drinking soda , and we talked for a while. he gave me the recommendation . 4. 2/9 : the 'before ' image on this post was taken at my body analysis , one of the requirements for the surgery . 5. march - july : * 12 weeks of classes ( once per week ) 5. august : surgery 6. august - now : continue to eat healthy , log everything i eat and drink. exercise 4+ days per week. ( lots of protein ) 7. 2/14/16 : walk my 5k 8. the future : keep moving and working towards a healthy weight . my original goal was to get under 200 pounds. however , i have revised that goal... instead i will get to my recommended weight ( 125 - 135 pounds ) . i forecast it will take me another year , but i am determined to succeed . * the health plan i have has one of the best programs in the country. the main reason is the prep work. you ca n't just walk in and get cut on. you have to qualify . 1. a referral from your doctor 2. complete a body analysis 3. take 12 classes that cover everything from what to expect from the surgery , how to eat before and after , how to exercise , mental health issues , interpersonal relationships , vitamins... very comprehensive 4. complete lab work ( including some gross stuff ) 5. complete and submit a weekly food journal 6. see a mental health professional 8. exercise 30 minutes a day 3 - 4 days per week 7. lose 10 % of your weight ( i lost 17 % before ) i took the program very seriously. i 've tried every diet under the sun. i felt like this was my last chance. i did everything they wanted of me . i know some people will see i had surgery and think i took a short cut , the easy way out. those people are wrong. the surgery is a tool... a very painful and exhausting tool. it is not a cure-all. i did and am still doing the work. i will have to keep it up for the rest of my life... my life ( that i can now see for the first time in a long time ) exceeding 50 .",d00p8r8,progresspics,lifestyle,1455550234,trekbette,115,0,11138,56137,

"so i have two dishes that i just cant get back to their original clarity. one of which is a nutribullet cup , which is a durable clear plastic. mine came with three cups , but i only use the big one , so i can see how the new ones look crystal clear , and the one i use even though i wash it thoroughly by hand ( apartment does n't have dishwasher ) it stays cloudy. what can i do ? i 've tried olive oil and toothpaste and they only worked for a little bit until i rinsed them off .",43vewb,lifehacks,lifestyle,1454436273,GTrogan39,176,0,147,189,
"couple questions : -does it say anywhere what plastic the cups are made out of ? like a recycling code or in the manual ? -have they ever gotten hot for any reason ? microwave , dishwasher , boiling water , etc ? -is it localized cloudiness or widespread/even ? i suspect that something induced crystallization in the polymer which unfortunately means you 're probably not going to get it back to the original clarity. essentially whatever plastic the items are made of has a specific glass transition temperature where the polymer chains can start to move again ( not the same as melting ) and if that temperature was exceeded they were able to rearrange into more stable crystallites which are not optically clear. olive oil , vinegar , etc wo n't do anything because the polymer chains themselves have rearranged . if this is indeed what happened , the only chance you 've really got ( and i 'm not sure how feasible this is in a home setting without polymer processing equipment ) is to heat it past the glass transition and then quench cool it super fast so that the crystallites break apart and do n't have enough time to reform before they lose mobility",czlb10h,lifehacks,lifestyle,1454440542,drebunny,13,0,759,5400,
